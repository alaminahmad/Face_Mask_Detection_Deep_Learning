# Face Mask Detection Deep Learning

In an era where health and safety concerns have taken center stage, technologies like face mask detection have become pivotal in ensuring public health compliance. Leveraging the power of deep learning and transfer learning, we can create highly accurate and efficient face mask detection models. In this article, we’ll explore the concept of face mask detection using TensorFlow, a popular deep-learning framework.


Understanding the Problem
The goal of face mask detection is to develop a model that can accurately classify whether a person is wearing a face mask or not. This task falls under the broader category of image classification, and we’ll employ transfer learning to make it more accessible.


Transfer Learning with TensorFlow
Transfer learning involves using a pre-trained neural network and fine-tuning it for a specific task. In our case, we’ll use a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as our base model. TensorFlow provides a plethora of pre-trained models that we can choose from, such as MobileNetV2, Inception, or ResNet. The figure below shows the architecture of MobileNetV2
